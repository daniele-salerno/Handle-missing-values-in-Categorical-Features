[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-orange.svg)]()

The purpose of this project is to show different ways to deal with missing values on categorical features.
I have use the [Classified Ads for Cars](https://www.kaggle.com/mirosval/personal-cars-classifieds) dataset from Kaggle to predict the price of ADs through a simple model of Linear Regression. 

In order to show the various strategies and relevants pros / cons, we will focus on a particular categorical feature of this dataset, the **maker**, the name of the brand of cars (Toyota, Kia, Ford, Bmw, ...). 

We will cover the following techniques:
* **Replace** missing values with the *most frequent values*.
* **Delete** rows with null values.
* **Predict** values using a Classifier Algorithm (supervised or unsupervised)
